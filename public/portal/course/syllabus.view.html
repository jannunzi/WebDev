<h4>Title IX</h4>

<p>
  Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the
  same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such
  as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate
  resources here: http://www.northeastern.edu/oidi/titleix/
