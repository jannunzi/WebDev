    In this course we will be building Web applications.
    Web applications are applications that use various Web
    technologies as building blocks. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    and Angular will be used to build the front directly
    interacting with users. As users interact with the
    Web application they will be generating a sequence of
    HTTP requests directed at a server built on Node.js
    and Express, a popular Node.js library. The server
    will handle the requests and use Mongoose (another
    very popular Node.js library) to store and retrieve
    a data model from MongoDB, a NoSQL database. 
    
    The front end, web services, and data access and storage
    are all hosted and/or configured in a Node.js runtime
    instance.
    
    This module covers Node.js installation and configuration.
