      OpenShift
    </a>
      
    is a platform as a service that allows creating hosted instances
    of HTTP servers and databases. We will use OpenShift to host our
    Web applications online. This course itself is hosted at OpenShift
    as a Node.js Web application. This lecture covers how to create
    simple OpenShift Node.js Web applications.

<h3>Creating a Node.js Web project on OpenShift </h3>

<p>
  
  In this video we show you how to create a simple Node.js
  Web application in OpenShift. You will have to create an
  account at
  
  <a href="openshift.com">
    OpenShift.com
  </a>
  
  and have already installed git. You will also have had to
  install rhc,
  
  <a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html">
    Redhat's OpenShift client tools
  </a>, and have installed
  
  <a href="nodejs.org">
    Node.js
  </a>

<h3>Replace OpenShift Node.js default Web app with simpler version</h3>

<p>
  Once you have created the sample OpenShift Node.js Web application,
  you may want to replace its <code>server.js</code> implementation.
  This video shows you how to use Node.js's Express module to create
  a very simple <code>hello.html</code> page and publish it to
  OpenShift.

<h3>Adding GitHub as a remote repository</h3>

<p>
  Once you have deployed your application to OpenShift, you will
  also need to push your code to a public code repository such
  as GitHub. The TAs and instructor will use GitHub to view your
  code and grade you. Make sure to invite the TAs and instructor
  as admin members of your repository.
