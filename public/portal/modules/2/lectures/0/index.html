  <h3>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
  <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: 
  
    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a simple language that uses XML elements to format plain text for Web browsers. HTML uses XML elements to tell Web browsers how to render various pieces of text. For instance the &lt;b&gt; or bold element tells the browser to render a piece of text as bold. The &lt;h1&gt; element is one of several header elements that tells the browser to render a piece of text as a header of some section of the Web page. There are many HTML elements for a variety of formatting options: tables, lists, paragraphs, form elements, and hyperlinks.

  In this video we cover the basic structure of Web pages implemented
  as HTML documents. We cover the basics on how Web browsers interpret
  HTML elements and render content accordingly.

  This video covers several of the more common HTML elements such as
  headers, paragraphs and lists. These are used to break up the content
  into various logical sections and subsections and render data hierarchically
  using lists.

<p>
  HTML has mostly been concerned with formatting Web pages for human
  consumption. An increasingly important concern is formatting content
  consummed by non human, automated processes such as search engines
  and indexing software. Humans can parse content and identify meaning
  from the page layout and syntax formatting, e.g., identify dates,
  first and last names, addresses, main content, etc. To allow automated
  processes to retrieve the same context information, there has been
  various efforts to format content with semantic elements. This video
  covers some of the more common HTML semantic elements.

<p>
  Web sites are often broken up ito various Web pages. The most common
  mechanism to navigate from page to page is to use hyperlinks. These
  are short pieces of text that can be configured to refer to or link
  to other pages when the text is clicked. In this video we implement
  Hyperlinks using HTML anchor elements.
