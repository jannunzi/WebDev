  <h3>Box Model</h3>
  <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>:
  
  The content in a Web page basically consists of various rentangular
  regions that can render with the content flow, render vertically or
  horizontally, render with a specific width, height, border, and white
  space based on various rules and sizes of the content. Collectively
  these rules are captured as a "box model". The

<h4>The CSS Box Model</h4>

<p>
  The content in HTML documents (Web pages) consists of a collection
  of rectangular areas, or boxes, layed out to cover the browser
  window. The white spaces between these boxes, how they flow and
  wrap, and how they interact with one another is collectively
  referred to as the "Box Model".
</p>

<p>
  The box model controls the look-and-feel and behaviour of the
  content on a page. Three of the more common CSS properties that
  control the box model are: <code>border</code>, <code>margin</code>,
  and <code>padding</code>. These
  three properties control the white space within and between
  HTML block elements. 
</p>

<p style="border: 10px red dotted">
  This paragraph's border has been configured to have a 10px wide,
  red dotted border. Applying this styling can be accomplished in
  various ways. We can use the <code>style</code> attribute right
  on the paragraph element: <code>style="border: 10px red dotted"</code>,
  but inline styles are generally frowned upon. Instead we can
  decalre a CSS rule in the <code>style</code> element in the
  <code>head</code> element. The following CSS rule would do
  the trick:
</p>

<pre>
p {
  border: 10px red dotted;
}</pre>

<h4>Controlling Element Position with CSS</h4>

<p>
  Browsers parse HTML documents they download from the Web and render
  the content as stipulated by the HTML elements and style it based on
  the CSS style sheet. Elements render from top to bottom
  and left to right, without overlapping each other. The CSS
  <code>position</code> property allows overriding the default
  position behavior of HTML elements. The <code>position</code>
  property can have one of the following values:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>static</code> is the default value for HTML elements
    and elements are not affected by position properties
    <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>,
    or <code>right</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>relative</code> positions elements relative to their
    default position. So if an element normally ends up rendering at
    top : 100px, and left : 200px, then position attributes such
    as <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>,
    or <code>right</code> will nudge the element in that direction
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>fixed</code> positions elements relative to the browser
    window at particular location
    and it stays there even if the page scrolls
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>absolute</code> positions elements relative to the
    nearest parent that is not <code>static</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Controlling Element Visibility with CSS</h4>

<p>
  By default elements are rendered at some physical area of the
  browser window. Their content is visible within a determined
  rectangular area of the window. CSS allows controlling whether
  an element is actually rendered or not. There are two basic
  ways to do this; either with the <code>visibility</code>
  CSS property or the <code>display</code> property. The
  <code>visibility</code> property can have one of the following values:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>visible</code> is the default value and makes the content visible</li>
  <li><code>hidden</code> does not render the content, but the rectangular area
      that the content would have occupied is still visible. In other words
      the content is invisible, but we know of its presence because of it's
      surroundings. Like a blackhole, we can't see it, but we know it's there
      because we see something is missing :)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>collapse</code> is used hide an entire table row 
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>initial</code> resets the visibility to what ever it was by default
    before it might have changed, perhaps defined by a parent element
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>inherit</code> derives the value of the <code>visibility</code>
    property from its parent element 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Controlling Element Depth with CSS</h4>  

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1673571/sp/167357100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/22492681/partner_id/1673571?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_e93bw6s1&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;&wid=1_v0593k5a" width="720" height="486" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
  Browsers parse HTML documents they download from the Web and render
  the content as stipulated by the HTML elements and style it based on
  the CSS style sheet. Elements render from top to bottom
  and left to right, without overlapping each other. Using the CSS
  <code>position</code> property it is possible to remove HTML elements
  from the normal rendering order and even force elements to overlap
  others. When elements overlap, document order is used to decide
  which elment renders on top of the other. Document order is the
  order in the HTML file document where the element is declared.
  That is, HTML elements declared earlier in the HTML document have
  lower document order than HTML elements declared later in the
  same HTML document. Lower order elements are rendered earlier
  than elements with higher element order, therefore, later
  elements render above earlier elements.
</p>

<p>
  The CSS property <code>z-index</code> allows to override this
  behavior and declare a specific rendering order. By default
  all HTML elements have the same <code>z-index</code> of 0 and
  document order is used to decide order of overlapping elements.
  Elements with a higher <code>z-index</code> will render above
  elements with lower <code>z-index</code>. For instance, the two
  <code>div</code> elements below don't have a <code>z-index</code>
  so <code>div#one</code> renders below <code>div#two</code> if
  they overlap.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  <code>z-index</code> can override the default rendering order.
  The example below uses <code>z-index</code> to render
  <code>div#one</code> renders above <code>div#two</code> if
  they overlap.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;style&gt;
  div#one {
    z-index : 2;
  }
  div#two {
    z-index : 1;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
